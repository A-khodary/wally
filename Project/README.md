# README.md

All projects in development.

## Principles

1. Projects should be created with care. Not everything is a project, especially tutorials (that's just note.)

2. Notes are taken in org-mode. And codes are tracked and managed by org-babel.

3. Every project should contains a README.md and a ChangeLog.txt

## Notes

1. Projects are not classified by their languages. Instead just put a *language tag*.

2. Projects are named in _Capitalized_ word, and should not contain any underscore.

3. *Projectile* are used to manage all projects,  so every project should initialized with a _.projectile_ file
